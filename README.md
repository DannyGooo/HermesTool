# HermesTool
Welcome to our project! Here, you'll find our specially crafted solutions designed for the Hermes engine, complete with built-in tools tailored for both Ubuntu and macOS platforms.

Within this repository, our customized builds for hbcdump and hermesc play a pivotal role in the hermeser module. This module serves to streamline the conversion process from Hermes Bytecode/JavaScript to Jimple, offering enhanced functionality and efficiency. Join us on this journey as we bridge the gap between these languages and facilitate seamless transformations.

hbcdump:  Hermes bytecode disassembler

hermesc: Standalone Hermes compiler. This can compile JavaScript to Hermes bytecode, but does not support executing it.
